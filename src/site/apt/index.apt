 Welcome to <<bworld-myApt>> Web site!
 
 <<myApt>> is a Java standalone command-line application that aims at generating code in the
 <Almost Plain Text> (APT) Doxia Format.
 
 APT is a convenient plain text format mainly useful to write a Maven project documentation Web site.
 For further information, see {{{http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html}The APT format}}
 on the Maven Web Site (2012-02-15).
 
 [Note:]

 More and more badly designed in terms of Object Oriented Program! The more quick new functionalities are developped, the more repeats there are, the more the lack of a complete refactoring is necessary... Nevertheless, I have used the {{{./myApt.sh}myApt.sh}} and {{{./myAptLink.sh}myAptLink.sh}} scripts tens of times a day since 2 years without any bug ;) If these two previous scripts are extremly useful to me, I have not used the other shortcut scripts to invoke the {{{./myApt.jar}myApt.jar}} with custom options ("myAptMonth" or "myAptImage") for a long time...
